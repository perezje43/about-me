      <h3 class="about">About Me</h3>
        <p>I am 23 years old and am a Seattle Native. I think I've had the quintessential Seattle upbringing. I was a barist at Starbucks in college and then worked for a start-up called Zipwhip soon after. My favorite foods are ice cream and steak. I have a twin brother. One of my favorite places I've recently visited is DC. One of my goals in traveling are trying things that I normally can't back home. I regretfully didn't get a chance to try the Dunkin Donut's coffee while in the East Coast and In'N'Out while in San Francisco this year. A goal of mine this summer is to learn how to ride a motorcycle and skydive.</p>
